telephony-sys-tests
===================

Utilizes Cucumber (http://cukes.info) and Cucumber-Nagios (http://github.com/auxesis/cucumber-nagios/) to provide telephony systems testing for human readable feedback and feedback for the Nagios monitoring platform.


Requirements 
============

Ruby 1.8.5+ (although 1.8.7+ is recommended)


Getting the project
===================

You may either download the Zip/Tar file or use Git to clone the project:

    $ git clone git://github.com/jsgoecke/telephony-sys-tests.git


Tests Available
===============

- ping_asterisk_manager.feature

  Logs in into the Asterisk (http://asterisk.org) Manager Interface, sends a ping and inspects the result for a pong.

- ping_adhearsion_ami.feature

  Connects to Adhearsion (http://adhearsion.com) via DRb, sends a ping to the Asterisk Manager Interface via Adhearsion and inspects the result for a pong.


Running
=======

Invoke the Cucumber feature with the cucumber-nagios script: 

    bin/cucumber-nagios telephony-sys-tests/features/ping_asterisk_manager.feature

cucumber-nagios can be run from anywhere: 

    /path/to/bin/cucumber-nagios /path/to/telephony-sys-tests/features/ping_asterisk_manager.feature

It should return a standard Nagios-formatted response string: 

    Critical: 0, Warning: 0, 3 okay | passed=3, failed=0, total=3

Steps that fail will show up in the "Critical" total, and steps that pass 
show up in the "okay" total. 

The value printed at the end is in Nagios's Performance Data format, so it
can be graphed and the like.
